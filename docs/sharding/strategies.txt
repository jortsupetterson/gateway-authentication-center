96 shards for id routing, shard seed is a plain normalized email as it stays the same regardless of rotations and
the simple row meant for finding an id can be easily migrated incase a user wants to chance the email that "points"
to their account. 96 physical shards meaning d1 instancess is also enough for handling this system on a global scale

4096 credential shards for storing seed based on 3 first hex from user_id webAuthn credentials this should be sufficent as it can reach up to 40 tb of storage in
physical d1 shards

then of course for both we start with virtual shard as much as declared and add physical shards when needed

for relying parties we might consider maybe 96 shards because at the end of the day there is a limited ammount of applications on the web
